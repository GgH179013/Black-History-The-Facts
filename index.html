  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mary Prince</strong></h2>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;General</h3>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/froala-eu/temp_files%2F1574529611830-Screenshot+2019-11-23+at+17.01.29.png" style="width: 250px;" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-rounded fr-dii">Mary Prince was born into an in slaved family in Bermuda. She was born
      in 1788 and died in 1833. She is renowned as being the first women to present an anti-slavery petition to parliament in 1829. She unfortunately died at the age of 45.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 160px;"><span lang="EN">If Prince was still alive and in good health, she may then have returned as a free woman to her homeland.</span> She is known to have remained in England until at least 1833, when she testified in the two libel cases. That year, the Slavery
      Abolition Act was passed, to be effective August 1834.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-left: 160px;"><br></h3>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Her Autobiography</h3>
  <p>Escaped to London and she wrote a autobiography (1831) called the history of Mary prince, it was the first account of the life of a black woman to be published in the United Kingdom, It was reprinted twice in its first year. It had a massive effect on
      the slave trade, yet it was not abolished in the West Indies until 1834.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Freedom</h3>
  <p>In Antigua, she joined the Moravian Church, where she also attended classes and learned to read. She was baptised in the English church in 1817 and accepted for communion, but she was afraid to ask Adams Wood for permission to attend. According to Mary,
      her floggings increased after her marriage because Adams Wood and his wife did not want a free black man living on their property.</p>
  <p>In December 1826, she married Daniel James, a former slave who had similarly bought his freedom and worked as a carpenter and cooper. Prince&rsquo;s life after her book was published is not much known. It is not clear whether she ever returned to Antigua
      and her husband as she had wished.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Work</h3>
  <p>As a child Mary worked in poor conditions in the salt ponds up to her knees in water. Due to the nature of salt mining, Mary and others were often forced to work up to 17 hours straight as owners of the ponds were concerned that if the workers were gone
      for too long rain would come and soil the salt. Generally, men were the salt rakers, forced to work in the salt ponds, where they were exposed to the sun and heat, as well as the salt in the pans, which ate away at their uncovered legs. Women did
      packaging of salt.</p>
  <p>Mary Prince was returned to Bermuda in 1810, where her master at the time had moved with his daughter. While here, she was physically abused by her master, and forced to bathe him under threat of further beatings. Mary resisted her master&rsquo;s abuse
      on two occasions: once, in defence of his daughter, whom he also beat; the second time, defending herself from her master when he beat her for dropping kitchen utensils. After this, she left his direct service and was hired out to Cedar Hill for a
      time, where she earned money for her master by washing clothes.</p>
  <p>In 1815, Mary was sold a fourth time, to John Adams Wood of Antigua for $300 (2017: ~$4600. She worked in his household as a domestic slave, attending the bedchambers, nursing a young child, and washing clothes. There she began to suffer from rheumatism,
      which left her unable to work. When Adams Wood was traveling, Mary earned money for herself by taking in washing.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Olaudah Equiano</strong></h2>
  <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/froala-eu/temp_files%2F1574538388864-Screenshot+2019-11-23+at+16.44.30.png" style="width: 250px;" class="fr-fic fr-fil fr-rounded fr-dii">Olaudah Equiano was an African writer who became involved in the British
      abolition movement because of his own experiences as a slave.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Early Life</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 260px;">Olaudah Equiano was born in the Eboe province (now known as southern Nigeria). In his autobiography he describes how he was kidnapped at the age of 11, along with his sister and how they were sold by local slave traders and taken to Barbados by ship and
      then on to Virginia in the USA. There aren&rsquo;t any written records so it is difficult to know how accurate Equiano&#39;s description of his early life is. Some people have raised doubts about its accuracy because in later life he listed a birthplace
      as being in the Americas more than once. However, everything else that Equiano describes in his autobiography has since been verified.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Life As A Slave</h3>
  <p>Once in Virginia he was sold to a Royal Navy officer called Lieutenant Michael Pascal. Pascal renamed him &#39;Gustavus Vassa&#39; after the 16th-century Swedish king. Equiano travelled the seas whilst he was with Pascal and he was baptised and he learned
      to read and write.</p>
  <p>After eight years Equiano was sold to a ship captain in London and taken to Montserrat in the Caribbean. Here he was sold to a merchant called Robert King. He worked as a deckhand, a valet and a barber whilst he was with King and managed to earn money
      by trading on the side. After just three years he had managed to make enough money to buy his freedom.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Life As A Free-Man</h3>
  <p>Equiano spent the next twenty years as a free man travelling around &nbsp;the world, even visiting the arctic.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In 1786 Equiano became involved in the movement to abolish slavery in London, England. He became a well known member of the &#39;Sons of Africa&rsquo; which was a group of 12 men of colour who campaigned for the abolition of slavery.</p>
  <p>He published his autobiography in 1789 and it was called: &rsquo;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano or Gustavus Vassa, the African&#39;. The book was widely read and not only helped the abolitionist cause, but also made Equiano a
      wealthy man. It is one of the earliest published books that was written by a black African writer.</p>
  <p>Equiano went on to marry an English woman called Susanna Cullen in 1792 and they had two daughters together.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Equiano died in 1797 on the 31 March.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Frederick Douglass</strong></h2>
  <p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/froala-eu/temp_files%2F1574611835686-Fredrick+Doglass+Fact+File+Screen-Shot.png" style="width: 250px;" class="fr-fic fr-rounded fr-dii fr-fil">Frederick Douglass was one of the leaders of the abolition of slavery
      movement. He was also a pioneer in the area of women&rsquo;s rights and he was the author of an autobiographical book about his life called &lsquo;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.&rsquo;</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Early Life</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Frederick Douglass was born a slave in Talbot County which is in Maryland USA around 1818.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The exact date and year of his birth are not known which was often the case for people born into slavery. However, later in life he chose to celebrate his birthday on valentines day (February 14).&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">In his early life Douglass lived with his mother&rsquo;s mother, Betty Bailey, but he was then brought to live in the home of the plantation owners (it is thought that one of the plantation owners might have been his biological father). His mother died
      when he was around 10 years old.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Learning to Read and Write</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Many slaves at this time were not taught to read or write because there was a ban preventing slave owners from doing so. However, Douglass was taught the alphabet when he was around twelve by the wife of the plantation owner, a woman named Sophia. Eventually
      Sophia was forbidden by her husband, but Douglass continued to learn with the help of adults and children in the neighbourhood.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 260px;">The more Douglas read, the more his ideas about human rights and his opposition to slavery began to develop and he started to share his ideas and knowledge with other enslaved people. He taught other slaves on the plantation to read the so that they could
      read the New Testament at their weekly church service. Although his plantation owner did not interfere, other local slave owners were not so understanding and they reacted with violence to disperse the congregation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>At the age of sixteen Douglas was made to work for another slave owner named Edward Covey. Covey had a reputation for violence against his slaves and the constant abuse Douglas received nearly broke him psychologically. Eventually, he fought back and
      after losing a physical confrontation with Douglass, Covey was never to beat him again. Douglass tried on two occasions to escape from slavery before he was finally successful.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Wider impact&nbsp;</h3>
  <p>By the end of his life Douglas had became one of the most famous intellectuals of his time, he was involved in advising presidents and he lectured to thousands of people on a range of different causes, including women&rsquo;s rights and Irish home rule.&nbsp;</p>
